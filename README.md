# amplifier-bundle-superpowers

Amplifier bundle for [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), the excellent agentic skills framework and software development methodology created by [Jesse Vincent](https://github.com/obra).

## About Superpowers

[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is a battle-tested development methodology that transforms how AI coding agents work. Rather than letting agents jump straight to writing code, Superpowers enforces a disciplined workflow: design first, plan carefully, implement with TDD, and review rigorously. The result is agents that can work autonomously for hours without deviating from your plan.

The project has earned significant community adoption (43k+ stars) for good reason - it works. The core skills (brainstorming, test-driven development, subagent-driven development, systematic debugging, and more) represent hard-won lessons about what makes AI-assisted development reliable.

This bundle brings full Superpowers support to [Amplifier](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier), including the original skills library, Amplifier-native agents for the key workflow roles, workflow modes, and a recipe for the subagent-driven development pattern.

## What This Bundle Provides

- **The complete Superpowers skills library** - All 14 original skills, loaded via Amplifier's skills system
- **5 specialized agents** - Amplifier-native agents for brainstorming, planning, implementation, and two-stage review
- **6 workflow modes** - `/brainstorm`, `/write-plan`, `/execute-plan`, `/debug`, `/verify`, `/finish` as Amplifier mode shortcuts
- **Subagent-driven development recipe** - The core execution workflow as a declarative Amplifier recipe
- **Composable behavior** - Include just the methodology in your own bundles

## Quick Start

The recommended way to use Superpowers is to install the behavior at your app level. This works with **any active bundle** - you don't need to switch away from your current setup:

```bash
# Install (once)
amplifier bundle add --app git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-superpowers@main#subdirectory=behaviors/superpowers-methodology.yaml

# Use it (in any session, with any bundle)
amplifier
```

The agent now has the Superpowers methodology and will suggest modes when appropriate. You can also activate modes directly:

```
/brainstorm    # Design before code
/write-plan    # Create implementation plan
/execute-plan  # Build with subagent-driven development
/debug         # Systematic 4-phase debugging
/verify        # Evidence-based completion verification
/finish        # Branch completion (merge/PR/keep/discard)
```

Or run the full automated pipeline:

```
"run the superpowers full development cycle recipe for [your feature]"
```

Or add it directly to `~/.amplifier/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
includes:
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-superpowers@main#subdirectory=behaviors/superpowers-methodology.yaml
```

This gives you the 5 specialist agents and methodology context layered on top of your existing bundle.

### Alternative: Full Bundle

If you want the complete standalone experience with modes, recipes, and skills:

```bash
# Install (once)
amplifier bundle add --app git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-superpowers@main

# Use it
amplifier
```

Same usage as above — modes and recipes are included directly in the bundle.

## The Workflow

```
/brainstorm → Design Document
     ↓
/write-plan → Implementation Plan (bite-sized tasks)
     ↓
/execute-plan → Subagent-Driven Development
     ↓
     Per Task:
     1. Implementer agent (implements + tests + commits)
     2. Spec reviewer agent (validates against spec)
     3. Code quality reviewer agent (ensures quality)
     ↓
Finished → PR or Merge
```

## Modes

The bundle provides six workflow modes:

| Mode | Shortcut | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `brainstorm` | `/brainstorm` | Design refinement - explore approaches and trade-offs |
| `write-plan` | `/write-plan` | Create detailed implementation plan with TDD tasks |
| `execute-plan` | `/execute-plan` | Execute plan with subagent-driven development |
| `debug` | `/debug` | Systematic debugging with investigation-before-fixes discipline |
| `verify` | `/verify` | Verification and evidence-gathering before completion claims |
| `finish` | `/finish` | Branch completion with merge/PR/keep/discard options |

Use `/modes` to list all available modes, `/mode off` to exit a mode.

## Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `superpowers:brainstormer` | Facilitates design refinement through dialogue |
| `superpowers:plan-writer` | Creates detailed implementation plans |
| `superpowers:implementer` | Implements tasks following strict TDD |
| `superpowers:spec-reviewer` | Reviews code against spec compliance |
| `superpowers:code-quality-reviewer` | Reviews code quality and best practices |

## Skills Library

The original [Superpowers skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) are fetched automatically from GitHub and available via the skills tool:

- **test-driven-development** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause analysis
- **brainstorming** - Design refinement process
- **writing-plans** - Implementation plan creation
- **subagent-driven-development** - Task execution with reviews
- **verification-before-completion** - Prove it works

Use `load_skill(search="superpowers")` to discover all available skills.

## Composing the Methodology

The behavior install (shown in Quick Start) is the recommended approach - it layers the Superpowers agents and methodology on top of whatever bundle you already use, without changing your providers, tools, or other configuration.

You get all 5 agents (`superpowers:brainstormer`, `superpowers:plan-writer`, `superpowers:implementer`, `superpowers:spec-reviewer`, `superpowers:code-quality-reviewer`) and the methodology context.

For bundle authors who want to include the methodology in their own bundle YAML:

```yaml
includes:
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-superpowers@main#subdirectory=behaviors/superpowers-methodology.yaml
```

## Acknowledgments

This bundle exists because of the outstanding work by [Jesse Vincent](https://github.com/obra) and the contributors to [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). The methodology, skills, and workflow patterns in this bundle originate from that project. We built this bundle to bring Superpowers support to Amplifier users because we believe it represents some of the best thinking on how to make AI-assisted software development disciplined and reliable.

The original Superpowers skills library is fetched directly from GitHub at runtime and cached locally - this bundle adds Amplifier-native agents, modes, and recipes on top of that foundation.
